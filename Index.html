    <h2>So, what exactly is air pollution?</h2>
        <p> Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the Earth's atmosphere. These substances can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases, and they can come from both natural and human-made sources. The key issue with air pollution is that it can have adverse effects on the health of living organisms and the overall quality of the environment.
